# BigDataColab
Welcome to the homepage of MAGIC's BigData Colab. This github repo will be your one stop shop for the class. You can find the notebooks, cool articles, and more resources on the topics we're going to cover.

## About the class
The goal of this class is to expose curious and independent learners to python and basic data science and machine learning techniques. We'll cover the python language, general programming principles, important libraries and tools, and basic ML algorithms. We've designed the topics to be accessible to all levels, so while previous programming experience will be helpful, its certainly not required. In fact, its far more important to be curious and want to learn!

The class is going to be a combination of zoom "lectures" and mini-projects all based on a series of [Google Colab notebooks] (https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). In a colab notebook, you can create "cells" that can either hold text or run python code. All you need to run code in the notebooks is internet access. This is because Colab is built on top of the Google Cloud Platform. When you run code in a cell in Colab, it runs in Google's cloud and returns the output to your browser.
